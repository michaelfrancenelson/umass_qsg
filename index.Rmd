# Quantitative Sciences Group

Welcome to the QSG at the University of Massachusetts Amherst!

## What is QSG?

QSG is an ad hoc committee of the Environmental Conservation (ECo) Graduate Program in the Department of Environmental Conservation at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, whose goal is to improve quantitative literacy in environmental science and conservation among graduate students and faculty of ECo. 

> Quantitative literacy is the ability to understand and effectively apply quantitative methods, which is becoming increasingly important in environmental science and conservation.

The realm of quantitative sciences in environmental science and conservation includes an exceptionally broad range of topics and methods.

However, based on the experience, expertise, and anticipated needs of graduate students and faculty in ECo, QSG focuses on the following areas as they apply to environmental science and conservation:

- Study design
- Statistical modeling
- Spatial data analysis
- Systems modeling



## What is our mission?

With the overall goal of improving quantitative literacy in environmental science and conservation among ECo graduate students and faculty, QSG has three principal objectives:

### Design and teach quantitative sciences courses to ECo graduate students

- To this end, QSG offers a four-semester sequence of courses on the analysis of environmental data, in addition to the regular periodic offerings of courses on specialized topics in spatial data analysis and systems modeling.


### Provide quantitative sciences consultation to ECo graduate students and faculty.

- To this end, QSG consultations are available to offer advice in the areas of study design, analytical methodology and interpretation of results. 

<div class="redborder">
- NOTE: Due to the demands and constraints resulting from COVID19, we have temporarily suspended our regular weekly consultations.
- We are working on an updated schedule and will resume consultations as soon as possible.

### Provide tutorials and support for statistical modeling in R

- To this end, QSG is developing a series of tutorials on statistical modeling in R to aid students and faculty in the use of R for common statistical modeling applications in environmental conservation. 


## Who are we?

- QSG includes ECo faculty members with a particular interest and expertise in quantitative approaches in environmental conservation.
